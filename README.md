A simple and quick blogging website that gets the job done. Allows anyone to create a blog post. Create, edit, and modify your posts as effortlessly as possible.

This is a Minimum Viable Product, and so it will lack many features that modern blogs have.

This site features registration, login using authentication and authorization that utilize API routes I created, and a database it reads, writes to, and grabs data from to display the posts you see here.

## Why I Made This

**To deepen my experience in back-end development.**

Every step in the process, every component you see placed in, even everything down to the smallest amount of detail, was a learning experience for me.
Even if everything in the site may look a little "bland", I have planted my roots into gaining insight on how many of today's systems are implemented. The only thing left to work on is improvement.
